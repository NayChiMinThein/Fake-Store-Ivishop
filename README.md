# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Hello, this is my mini e-commerce practice project crafted using React, Redux Toolkit, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion, and more. It's a dynamic marketplace where smooth transactions meet captivating visuals, powered by the FakeStore API and expertly navigated with React Router. You can do add to cart, increase items, decrease items and remove items. In the future, I will add more features(maybe?).
